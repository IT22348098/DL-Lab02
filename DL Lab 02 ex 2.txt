What happens when hidden nodes increase?

	With very few nodes → underfitting (low accuracy).

	As nodes increase → the model can learn more complex decision boundaries → higher accuracy.

	Too many nodes → overfitting (training accuracy high, test accuracy worse).

Pattern of accuracy when hidden nodes increase?

	Generally: Low → increases → stabilizes → sometimes drops slightly if overfitting.

	You’ll observe a “sweet spot” where accuracy is best.
